# Project 1

## Working Project Title: 

Trip Buddy

## User Story:

As someone who likes to travel
I want to know the best things to do at my destination
So that I can maximize my trip

## Description:

We want to make an application for people to plan their trips. Once they enter in their destination it will generate travel info by driving, public transportation, bike, or walking. It will display the weather forcast, up to a week for their destination. And finally they will get a list of activities and restaurants to choose from.
